#### IBM Watson STT Service {#ibm-watson-stt-service}

Pros:

* 16 hours a month included in service
* 0.02 cent a minute after that
  [see pricing](http://www.autoedit.io/user_manual/setup-%28Pietro-s-MacBook-Pro's-conflicted-copy-2016-12-21%29.html)
* generally pretty accurate \(my opinion, judge for yourself\)
* supports a number of languages
  [see here](http://www.autoedit.io/user_manual/setup-%28Pietro-s-MacBook-Pro's-conflicted-copy-2016-12-21%29.html)
  including distiction between british and american english

Cons:

* Need to provide card details for pay as you go fee.
* is in the cloud so no offline support.

#### Gentle Open Source STT {#gentle-open-source-stt}

Pros:

* Free as in free speech as well as in free beer.
* working locally on your machine. no internet connection needed
* because of that, good for sensitive material.
* Open source
  [github repo](https://lowerquality.com/gentle)
  and
  [I made a node module to work with the API](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/gentle_stt_node)
  .

Cons:

* Not as accurate as IBM one \(in my opinion, but decide for yourself\).
* Only support english STT.
* At the moment not as fast as IBM one.
