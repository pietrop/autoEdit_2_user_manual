# Developer Options for Export

Both in transcription view and in paper-edit view, there is the option for developers to export a `json`, either of the transcription or of the paper-edit.

This is because autoEdit could be used as a starting point to build interactives that have some component that is "transcription powered".

## Example

For example, I once went to a POV hackathon, and finished 2 hours before the deadline thanks to this.

* [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19TB4CpkCDqMJQvhmZF3I9AN7IQ0VsIA8nsfpdHkfDss/)
* [interactive](http://pietropassarelli.com/BattleSounds/)
* [Notes on tech used](https://github.com/pietrop/BattleSounds/blob/master/notes.md)

The idea is that you can get the transcription \(or paper-edit\) `json` from autoEdit, as well as the converted webm video. [Combined with some client side tempting and a js logic](https://github.com/pietrop/BattleSounds/blob/master/docs/index.html#L171) can quickly make an "hyper-transcript" like the one in [Battle Sound](http://pietropassarelli.com/BattleSounds/) .
