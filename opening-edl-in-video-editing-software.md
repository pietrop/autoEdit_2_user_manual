#### **a Note on working with Final cut pro X**

For now a workaround for Final cut pro X not supporting EDL is that you can open the EDL in [Davinci resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) convert it to XML that will work with final cut X.



#### Align timecode

In adobe premiere there is an option to `align timecode`.

> The Align Timecode option is also checked by default to align the media file's source timecode to the clip being linked.
