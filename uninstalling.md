# Uninstalling 

For uninstalling the app on the mac use [app cleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/).

Note that the app saves the transcriptions as well as the audio and video previews media on your file system and not inside the app. This means that if you uninstall using [app cleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) you will lose those files.
