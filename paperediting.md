# Paper-editing

If first time using the tool go ahead and [setup the STT API system first](/setup-stt-apis.md). Then [add some videos or audio files to transcribe](/transcribing.md), these can then be used in the paper-edit

#### What is a paper-edit?

in autoEdit you can pull selections from various transcriptions, organise them into a story, and when you are done export that as a video sequence. Through an EDL file, edit decision list, that can be opened with your video editing software of choice to continue editing your video.

If you want to know more about what is paper-editing, and why should you bother, I once organised a workshop "_How to craft compelling stories out of video interviews?_" that focussed on the underlying evergreen storytelling principles that transcend the medium, introducing paper-editing in it's traditional  paper, scissors and tape as a key story crafting technique to gain insight into the process of interviewed based documentary production.  [Check out this blog post for the slide notes](http://pietropassarelli.com/wip_london_july2016.html).

This will take you back to the list of paper-edits, click on the one you just created to go to the next step.

### 2. Select text from transcriptions {#adding-a-videoaudio}

Chose a transcription on the left column.

Same as in [transcription view](/transcribing.md), if you click on the word the video starts playing at the corresponding point.

In this view when you select text from a transcription it gets automatically added to the paper-edit.

### 3. Add selection at a specific point {#adding-a-videoaudio}

As you have seen above by default your selections are added at the end of the paper-edit,  you can click on a papercut to set that as insert point for the next selection.

### 4. Add headings to your story {#adding-a-videoaudio}

To keep your story organised you can add headings/`story points`.

At present headings help you keep the story organised within autoEdit and are not included in the EDL export.
