# Support the project 

There is a number of ways you can support the project. 

#### Keep up to date with latest releases

Sign up to the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cMzwSX), follow on [twitter](http://twitter.com/autoEdit2) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/autoEdit.io/) to keep up to date with [the latest releases](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases). 


#### Help with translations
Help translate the user manual and app in different languages.


#### Help out with documentation 

If you read through the user manual, and things don't make sense, feel free to get in touch via email <a href="mailto:pietro@autoEdit.io?Subject=Hello" target="_top">pietro@autoEdit.io</a> or [@pietropassarell](twitter.com/pietropassarell) or [raise an issue on github](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2) chances are that if it's not clear to you it's not clear to others, and I'd love to lower the barry of entry as much as possible. Also always looking for people to proofread.


#### Give some feedback on use cases

If you have been using autoEdit I am always super interested in hearing about other people's production and post-production workflow, as well as projects they might have used it for, what has worked best and what hasn't.


#### For Developers

If you are a developer, and want to get involved, [check out how you could help out in the documentation section](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit-2-r-d-documentation-for-developers/content).  <!-- TODO: update this link -->


#### Support the project

Last but not least [autoEdit.io](www.autoEdit.io) it's free and open source. Free as in free speech as well as in free beer. [Help support the autoEdit project to keep it that way](https://donorbox.org/c9762eef-0e08-468e-90cb-2d00643697f8?recurring=true).  Support will go towards fixing bugs, adding features, provide support for users etc...
