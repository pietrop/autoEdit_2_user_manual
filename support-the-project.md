# Support the project

There is a number of ways you can support the project. 

## Keep up to date with latest releases

Sing up to the [mailing list](), follow on [twitter](http://twitter.com/autoEdit2) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/autoEdit.io/) to keep up to date with [the latest releases](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases). 

## Give some feedback on use cases

I am always super interested in hearing about what you have been using autoEdit for, what has worked best, what hasn't etc... 


## Help with translations
Help translate the user manual and app in different languages.

## Help out with documentation 

Especially if you are new to the project, and you read through the user manual, and things don't make sense, feel free to get in touch pietro@autoEdit.io or [@pietropassarell](twitter.com/pietropassarell) chances are that if it's not clear to you it's not clear to others, and I'd love to lower the barry of entry as much as possible. 


## Developers

If you are a developer, and want to get involved, [check out how you could help out in the documentation section](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit-2-r-d-documentation-for-developers/).  <!-- TODO: update this link -->


## Support the project

[autoEdit.io](www.autoEdit.io) it's free and open source. Free as in free speech as well as in free beer. [Help support the autoEdit project to keep it that way](). 

<!-- TODO: add link to donor page -->

Support will go towards fixing bugs, adding features, provide support for users etc...
