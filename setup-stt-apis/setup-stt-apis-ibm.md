[**Here is an unofficial guide to get the IBM Bluemix Speech to text credentials**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P9GQayzmoRHaDK_p4jPdMChfvQNCzmjQTNWmXFXkOiY/edit?usp=sharing)

{% endhint %}

When you first launch the app by double clicking on it you are taken to the credentials page. Where you can add IBM Watson Speech to text service username and password API keys.

_Note that these are not your IBM Bluemix credentials, but you have to create a speech to text service within Bluemix and get those credentials._
