# Paper-edit to sequence

![autoEdit panel paper edit to sequence](../.gitbook/assets/autoedit-panel-paper-edit-to-sequence.png)

Clicking `create sequence` in the panel inserts the paper-edit selections in a Premiere sequence.

There's a prompt to ask if you want to add to current sequence, or create a new sequence.

If adding to current sequence, it adds at the position of the playhead in the sequence.
