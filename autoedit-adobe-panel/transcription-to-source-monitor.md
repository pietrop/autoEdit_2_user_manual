It does not autoPlay. In Premiere you can use shortcut to play/pause the clip in the monitor.

You can also use Premiere's shortcut `cmd`+ `i` and `cmd` + `o` to set in and out point in the source monitor. 

and then can use `cmd` + `.` and `cmd` + `,` to insert or overwrite  in an active Premiere sequence.
